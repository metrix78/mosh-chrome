# Build the Native Client port of the Mosh client for running in the Chrome
# browser. Only works in Linux, perhaps only in Ubuntu Linux.
#
# To build the dev track (suitable for most development testing):
#   $ ./build.sh dev
#
# To build the release track:
#   $ ./build.sh release
#
# To build the Windows "native" installers:
#   $ ./build.sh windows-x64
#   $ ./build.sh windows-ia32
#
# To build an unoptimized debug version of the dev track (for use with gdb):
#   $ ./build.sh debug
#
# To run unit tests:
#   $ ./build.sh test
#
# To lint all C++ files:
#   $ ./build.sh lint
#
# To do a clang-format pass over the code:
#   $ ./build.sh format
